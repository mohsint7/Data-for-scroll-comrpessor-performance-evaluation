    as a result you can get asperity-asperity contact and much higher friction

    Short-bearing analysis is used.  Here we are implementing the equations from 
    the Ph.D. dissertation of Jay Kim (Purdue, 2005).  Knowing :math:`w_r` and 
    the dimensions we can then obtain :math:`\epsilon` using a 1D secant solver
    with the initial guess of :math:`\epsilon=0.5`.  Then we obtain 
    :math:`F_{shear}` for the given value of :math:`\epsilon`.

    One of ``design`` or ``c`` must be provided

        Journal Bearing and Its Application to Analysis and Design-I, -II,

    And further analysis presented in Hamrock:
    
        In Fig. 11.2 a recommended operating eccentricity ratio, or minimum film
        thickness, is indicated as well as a preferred operating area. The left boundary of
        the shaded zone defines the optimum eccentricity ratio for a minimum coefficient
        of friction, and the right boundary the optimum eccentricity ratio for maximum
        load. The recommended operating eccentricity for general application is midway
        between these two boundaries.
